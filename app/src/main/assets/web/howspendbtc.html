      <h2>How to Spend BCH from Your Bitcoin.com Wallet</h2>
<ol>
<li>Tap the &#8220;Send&#8221; tab.</li>
<li>Input the recipient&#8217;s address into the field at the top. Paste from clipboard or tap the &#8220;Scan&#8221; icon to open camera and scan their address&#8217;s QR code. Double-check the address to make sure it a) is correct and b) corresponds to the correct currency. <strong>Do not send BTC to a BCH address and vice-versa.</strong></li>

<li>Input the amount to send</li>
<li>Confirm the address and amount. Then swipe to send.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a transaction has been sent. You will see the transaction in your history. If sending BCH, the recipient should get the coins within minutes. 100% confirmation may take a few more minutes depending on the network traffic.</p>
<p>Securing Your Bitcoins and Protecting Yourself Online</p>
<p><span>That wraps up our guide to using the Bitcoin.com Wallet. In closing, we would like to remind you that the security of your Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core is entirely up to you. There is no Bitcoin transaction customer service to email if you lose your backup phrase. There is no &#8220;forget password&#8221; button. This might seem daunting but such is the nature of using a peer-to-peer, decentralized network like Bitcoin Cash. You are your own bank, that comes with responsibility. </span></p>
