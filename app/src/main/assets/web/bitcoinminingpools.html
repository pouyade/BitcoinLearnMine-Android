      <p>One of the first questions that anyone interested in mining cryptocurrencies faces is whether to mine solo or join a 'pool'. There are a multitude of reasons both for and against mining pools. However, if the hash rate distribution across the bitcoin network is anything to go by (and it is) then most miners are opting to join a pool. Here's what you need to know.</p>
<h2>Pros and cons</h2>
<p>If you're deciding whether to join a mining pool or not, it can be helpful to think of it like a lottery syndicate - the pros and cons are exactly the same. Going solo means you won't have to share the reward, but your odds of getting a reward are significantly decreased. Although a pool has a much larger chance of solving a block and winning the reward, that reward will be split between all the pool members.</p>
<p>Therefore, joining a pool creates a steady stream of income, even if each payment is modest compared to the full block reward (which currently stands at 25 XBTC).</p>
<p>It is important to note that it is important for a mining pool to not exceed over 51% of the hashing power of the network. If a single entity ends up controlling more than 50% of a cryptocurrency network's computing power, it could - theoretically - wreak havoc on the whole network. In early 2014, many voiced concerns that the GHash.io bitcoin mining pool was approaching this threshold, and miners were urged to leave the pool.</p>
