<h3>Hardware Wallets</h3>

   <img  src="hardwarewallets.png">
  <p>The Ledger Nano S is one example of a hardware wallet.</p>
 <p>A hardware wallet is a physical electronic device, built for the sole purpose of securing bitcoins.</p>
 <p>The core innovation is that the hardware wallet must be connected to your computer, phone, or tablet before bitcoins may be spent.</p>
 <p>The three most popular and best Bitcoin hardware wallets are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ledger Nano S
    </li>

    <li>
      TREZOR
    </li>

    <li>
      KeepKey
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Hardware wallets are a good choice if you’re serious about security and convenient, reliable Bitcoin storage. </p>
   <p>Bitcoin hardware wallets keep private keys separate from vulnerable, internet-connected devices.</p>
  <p>Your all-important private keys are maintained in a secure offline environment on the hardware wallet, fully protected even should the device be plugged into a malware-infected computer.</p>
  <p>As bitcoins are digital, cyber-criminals could, potentially, target your computer’s “software wallet” and steal them by accessing your private key.</p> <p>Generating and storing private keys offline using a hardware wallet ensures that hackers have no way to reach your bitcoins.</p>
  <p>Hackers would have to steal the hardware wallet itself, but even then, it can be protected with a PIN code.</p>
   <p>Don’t worry about your hardware wallet getting stolen, lost or damaged either; so long as you create a secret backup code, you can always retrieve your bitcoins.</p>
