      <h2>Theft and Scams</h2>
    <p>No matter which wallet you choose, remember: </p>
    <p>Your bitcoins are only safe if the private key was generated securely, remains a secret, and--most importantly--is controlled only by YOU!</p>
     <p>To avoid theft, scams, and any other loss of funds, follow these three basic principles: </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
      <b>Generate your private keys in a secure, offline environment</b>.
       (Except if using trivial amounts, in which cases keys may be created in a hot wallet).
     </li>
       <li>
         <b>Create backups of your private keys</b>.
          This helps to protect against the loss of your bitcoins due to hard drive failure or some other problem or accident. Ideally you should have a duplicate set of backups kept off-site to protect against the possibility of fire, robbery, etc.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Encrypt wallets to provide additional security</b>. This helps prevent the physical theft of your funds in the event that your device or hardware wallet is stolen.</li>
      </ul>

          <p>Securing your bitcoins properly is the most important step for any Bitcoin user.</p>
       <p>With Bitcoin you have the privilege - but also the responsibility - to safeguard your own money. There have been countless scams related to Bitcoin that could have been prevented had people not entrusted others with their bitcoins.</p>
       <p>Itâ€™s a good rule of thumb to never trust anyone else with your money.</p>
