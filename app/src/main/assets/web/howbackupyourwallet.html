  <span >Backup complete. Nice job!</span></p>
<p>If you ever lose your phone or get a new one you will use this phrase to verify that you are the owner of the wallet before being granted access. This is why it is important to keep the phrase safe and away from the eyes of others. Store the code as securely as you would cash or other valuables, you may lose your bitcoins forever if your device is lost, stolen or damaged and you chose not to backup. Some users laminate the paper or use some other means of keeping it safe from moisture or grime. Also, feel free to make several backup copies and store these in various safe places, e.g. bank safety deposit box, in a secure drawer, home safe, etc.</p>
