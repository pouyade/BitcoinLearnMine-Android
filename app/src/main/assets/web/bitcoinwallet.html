      <p>To send or receive Bitcoin Cash (BCH) or Bitcoin Core (BTC), you will need a Bitcoin wallet app. This guide covers how to install and use the basic features of the Bitcoin.com Wallet to receive and send Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC).</p>
      <p>(Update: Bitcoin Core is less usable as money due to much higher fees and delayed transaction times. The Core team has also expressed an interest in keeping these fees high since they view BTC as a &#8220;store-of-value&#8221; and not something to be transacted on a daily basis. In contrast, Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s transaction fees cost pennies and payments can be validated even with zero confirmations. These facts make BCH the ideal cryptocurrency for sending and receiving money anywhere in the world.)</p>
