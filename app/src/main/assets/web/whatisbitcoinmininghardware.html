      <h3>CPU Mining</h3>
<p>Early Bitcoin client versions allowed users to use their CPUs to mine. The advent of GPU mining made CPU mining financially unwise as the hashrate of the network grew to such a degree that the amount of bitcoins produced by CPU mining became lower than the cost of power to operate a CPU. The option was therefore removed from the core Bitcoin client's user interface.
</p>
<h3>GPU Mining</h3>
<p>GPU Mining is drastically faster and more efficient than CPU mining. . A variety of popular mining rigs have been documented.
</p>
<h3>FPGA Mining</h3>
<p>FPGA mining is a very efficient and fast way to mine, comparable to GPU mining and drastically outperforming CPU mining. FPGAs typically consume very small amounts of power with relatively high hash ratings, making them more viable and efficient than GPU mining.
</p>
<h3>ASIC Mining</h3>
<p>An application-specific integrated circuit, or <i>ASIC</i>, is a microchip designed and manufactured for a very specific purpose. ASICs designed for Bitcoin mining were first released in 2013. For the amount of power they consume, they are vastly faster than all previous technologies and already have made GPU mining financially.
</p>
<h3>Mining services (Cloud mining)</h3>
<p>Mining contractors provide mining services with performance specified by contract, often referred to as a "Mining Contract." They may, for example, rent out a specific level of mining capacity for a set price at a specific duration.
